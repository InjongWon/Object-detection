- A modified ResNet18 model was trained on the DBI dataset **without pre-trained weights**.
- Evaluation:
  - Accuracy was plotted on training, validation, and test sets.
  - The trained model was then tested on SDD for cross-dataset comparison.
- **Key Concept**: Domain generalization ‚Äî observing how a model trained on one dataset performs on another.

## üìì Notebook Details

### üìò `laplacian.ipynb` ‚Äì LoG Analysis & Gradient Visualization

- **Implementation**: Computes LoG response for a black square to find the optimal œÉ that maximizes response magnitude.
- Uses:
  - Manual generation of black-square-on-white images
  - Laplacian of Gaussian kernel formulas
- Also includes gradient visualization on sample images (likely used to validate orientation detection for HOG setup).

---

### üìò `local_HOG_descriptor.ipynb` ‚Äì Local HOG Feature Descriptor

Implements the full pipeline for extracting a **HOG descriptor** from images:

- **Gradient Calculation**:
  - Computes gradient magnitudes and angles using `np.gradient` or Sobel filters.
  - Applies thresholding to ignore low-strength gradients.

- **Cell Binning**:
  - Divides the image into fixed-size cells (e.g., 8x8).
  - Quantizes gradient orientations into 6 bins.
  - Two approaches implemented:
    - **Weighted HOG**: Accumulate magnitudes per bin
    - **Unweighted HOG**: Count pixel votes per bin

- **Quiver Visualization**:
  - Uses matplotlib‚Äôs `quiver` to draw orientations for each cell.

- **Normalization**:
  - Combines adjacent 2x2 cells into blocks
  - L2-normalizes the resulting 24-element block vector
  - Saves normalized descriptors as `.txt` for input images

- **Illumination Robustness**:
  - Evaluates HOG robustness to lighting by comparing with-flash vs no-flash grayscale images.
  - Files stored: `image_with_flash.txt`, `image_without_flash.txt`

### üìò `cornerEdgeDetection.ipynb` ‚Äì Corner Detection with Eigenvalues

- Implements eigenvalue-based corner detection using the **Second Moment Matrix**.
- Steps:
  - Computes image gradients (`Ix`, `Iy`)
  - Constructs the structure tensor (M) for each pixel
  - Calculates eigenvalues Œª‚ÇÅ and Œª‚ÇÇ using closed-form expressions
  - Scatter plots of eigenvalues are generated
  - Corners are identified where `min(Œª‚ÇÅ, Œª‚ÇÇ)` exceeds a chosen threshold
  - Experiments repeated with varying Gaussian œÉ values to evaluate smoothing effects
