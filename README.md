### `CannyEdge.ipynb` ‚Äì üì∑ Grayscale Image Display

- **Concepts**:
  - Image reading using OpenCV
  - Displaying images with `matplotlib`
- **Implementation Details**:
  - The image `s25.jpeg` is read in grayscale mode.
  - The image is displayed using `plt.imshow()` with proper color conversion (`cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB`).
  - Title and axis are configured for clean presentation.

### `Gaussian Blur.ipynb` ‚Äì üìê Sobel Filter & Gradient Magnitude

- **Concepts**:
  - Convolution with Sobel filters
  - Computing gradient magnitude
  - Manual implementation of convolution
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Functions:
    - `convolve()`: Applies a kernel to an image manually (zero padding + dot product).
    - `gradient_mag()`: Applies Sobel X and Y filters to compute the gradient magnitude.
    - `visualize_images()`: Displays the original and gradient images side by side.
  - Two grayscale images are processed and visualized to compare gradient magnitudes.

## üß† Implementation Highlights

### `trainCNN.ipynb` ‚Äì Custom CNN on DBI

- A lightweight CNN was trained from scratch on the DBI dataset.
- Techniques used:
  - Batch normalization
  - Dropout layers for regularization
  - Cross-entropy loss
  - Random cropping, flipping, and rotation for data augmentation
- **Goal**: Observe how dropout impacts training/test accuracy and generalization.

---

### `restNet18-34.ipynb` ‚Äì ResNet18 from Scratch

- A modified ResNet18 model was trained on the DBI dataset **without pre-trained weights**.
- Evaluation:
  - Accuracy was plotted on training, validation, and test sets.
  - The trained model was then tested on SDD for cross-dataset comparison.
- **Key Concept**: Domain generalization ‚Äî observing how a model trained on one dataset performs on another.

---

### `Fine-Tuning.ipynb` ‚Äì Fine-Tuning Pre-trained Models

- Models used:
  - `ResNet18`, `ResNet34`, and `ResNeXt50_32x4d` from PyTorch Hub
- Strategy:
  - Fine-tune the last layers while retaining learned representations
- Evaluation:
  - Performance tested on DBI and full SDD
- **Goal**: Compare generalization and overfitting across architectures

---

### `classifier_train.ipynb` ‚Äì Dataset Classifier

- Objective: Classify whether an image belongs to DBI or SDD
- Approach:
  - Used a pre-trained model (e.g. ResNet18) as base
  - Trained a binary classifier on dataset identity
- Evaluation: 
  - Model accuracy on test set
  - Confusion matrix and classification report
- **Goal**: Quantify and detect dataset-specific features that affect generalization
